   - Sensor data acquisition and calibration
   - WebSocket communication

2. **Frontend Clients**:
   - Desktop web interface (responsive design)
   - Mobile-optimized interface
   - Real-time control and visualization

3. **Hardware Components**:
   - Four-wheel drive chassis with differential steering

   - Servo-driven camera gimbal (2-axis pan/tilt)
   - Raspberry Pi 5 as the main computing platform
